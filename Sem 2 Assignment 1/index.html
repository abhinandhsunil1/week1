                <h3>Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the <span> OLD TOWN ROAD </span>
                    I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
                    I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
                    I'm gonna ride (Kio, Kio) 'til I can't no more
                    I got the <span>HORSES</span> in the back
                    Horse tack is attached
                    Hat is matte black
                    Got the boots that's black to match
                    Riding on a <span>HORSES</span>, ha
                    You can whip your <span>PORSCHE</span>
                    I been in the valley
                    You ain't been up off the porch now
                    Can't <span>NOBODY</span> tell me nothing
                    You can't tell me nothing
                    Can't nobody tell me nothing
                    You can't tell me nothing
                    Riding on a <span>TRACTIR</span>
                    Lean all in my bladder
                    Cheated on my baby
                    You can go and ask her
                    My <span>LIFE</span> is a movie
                    Bull riding and boobies
                    Cowboy hat from Gucci
                    <span>WRANGLER</span> on my booty
                    Can't nobody tell me nothing
                    You can't tell me nothing
                    Can't nobody tell me nothing
                    You can't tell me nothing
                    Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the <span>OLD TOWN ROAD</span>
                    I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
                    I'm gonna take my <span>HORSE</span> to the <span>OLD TOWN ROAD</span>
                    I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
                    Hat down, cross-town, livin' like a rockstar
                    Spent a lot of money on my <span>BRAND-NEW GITAR</span>
                    Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
                    <span>RIDIN</span>' down Rodeo in my <span>MASERATTI SPORTS CAR</span>
                    Got no stress, I've been through all that
                    I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
                    Wish I could roll on back to that <span>OLD TOWN ROAD</span>
                    I wanna ride 'til I can't no more
                    Yeah, I'm gonna take my <span>HORSE</span> to the <span>OLD TOWN ROAD</span>
                    I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
                    I'm gonna take my horse to the <span>OLD TOWN ROAD</span>
                    I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no <span>MORE</span>
